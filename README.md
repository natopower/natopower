### Hey! I'm Nate. ðŸ‘‹

I'll be real - I would have <b>never</b> seen myself on GitHub a couple of years ago.. but here I am.

<h2>Things I'm Working On:</h2>

### [weatherRemastered](https://github.com/kolbyd/weather-mod)
After years of playing Minecraft and enjoying the incredible Weather2 mod by Coros, I decided it was time for a refresh and an upgrade.

We're making a brand new project - the goal - to change weather in Minecraft forever. Details [here.](https://natepower.ca/weatherremastered)

### [CZWG-core](https://github.com/winnipegfir/CZWG-core)
Imagine you see someone pull up to their house with a newborn baby. Now imagine me, walking up, and somehow barely helping them take care of it. That's essentially my role on the Winnipeg FIR's website. 

In all seriousness, the team working on this has put in a pile of work, and we're very lucky that the [Gander Oceanic team](https://ganderoceanic.com) lended us their base to start us off. Now, here we are.
